# Market

The global asset management industry is a $128 trillion market ([BCG](https://www.bcg.com/press/29april2025-global-asset-management-record-high-critical-turning-point)) under strain from fee compression, inefficiencies, and high entry barriers—creating strong demand for decentralized solutions like HYRO. Meanwhile, the DeFi market, valued at $25.7 billion ([IMARC](https://www.imarcgroup.com/decentralized-finance-market), [GrandView](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-decentralized-finance-market)), is growing at a 38% CAGR, highlighting HYRO’s potential.

## Landscape

### Traditional Asset Management

* AUM reached $128 trillion in 2024, up 12% YoY ([AI-CIO](https://www.ai-cio.com/news/global-asset-management-aum-reaches-128t-in-2024/)).

* Despite AUM growth, revenues grew just 0.2% while costs rose 4.3%, squeezing margins ([CityAM](https://www.cityam.com/asset-management-industry-under-pressure-as-costs-rocket/)).

* Passive funds dominate with 84% of net flows, pushing fees down to 0.20–2.00% of AUM ([CFI](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/wealth-management/management-fees/)).

### DeFi Opportunity

* DeFi is at $25.7B, projected to reach $465.8B by 2033 ([IMARC](https://www.imarcgroup.com/decentralized-finance-market), [GrandView](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-decentralized-finance-market)).

* Solana’s TVL grew 600% to $9.7B in a year, with a $191B ecosystem market cap ([CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/solana-tvl-surges-600percent-in-a-year-as-trump-token-drives-dollar11-billion-in-trading-volume), [Bitget](https://www.bitget.com/price/category/solana-ecosystem)).

## Key Market Pain Points

High Fees & Inefficiency: Intermediaries inflate costs 20-50% ([IA](https://www.theia.org/sites/default/files/2019-04/20190425-costsandcharges.pdf)), passive margins have dropped 14-27% ([InstitutionalInvestor](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2bsw36sjfpd8ws4k8xkw0/corner-office/mckinsey-asset-managements-problems-are-here-to-stay)).

Opaque Performance: Legacy reporting delays transparency and consumes resources ([Broadridge](https://www.broadridge.com/white-paper/retooling-the-investment-management-industrys-performance-yardstick-for-new-realities)).

Access Barriers: Minimums range $100K–$1.5M, excluding most investors ([FasterCapital](https://fastercapital.com/content/Minimum-Investment--Entry-Barriers--The-Role-of-Minimum-Investment-in-Mutual-Funds-and-Hedge-Funds.html)).

Emerging Manager Struggles: 82% cite attracting capital as top challenge, with only 1.3% of AUM at minority firms ([Hedgeweek](https://www.hedgeweek.com/emerging-managers-struggle-capture-investors-attention/), [Milken](https://milkeninstitute.org/panel/11375)).

Slow Deployment: Typical capital deployment takes 2-4 years, cutting returns by \~1.5% annually if delayed ([T Rowe Price](https://www.troweprice.com/content/dam/gdx/pdfs/2022-q2/new-approach-to-managing-capital-awaiting-deployment.pdf)).

## Market Opportunity

* TAM: $128T global AUM, expected to hit $145T by 2025 ([PwC](https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/press-room/global-assets-under-management-set-to-rise.html)).

* SAM: DeFi’s $25.7B market scaling to $465.8B by 2033\.

* SOM: Targeting $250B+ in emerging manager assets, with 20-50% cost savings from fewer intermediaries and 50-70% faster deployment cycles via automation.
