# Protocol

HYRO operates as a decentralized, non-custodial vault protocol on Solana that establishes direct connections between Liquidity Providers (LPs) and asset managers through a comprehensive challenge-based verification system and flexible vault architecture.

## Core Protocol Components

**Vault System**
The protocol's foundation is built on smart contract-based vaults that provide secure, non-custodial capital management. Each vault operates with Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) and integrates with flexible policy systems for transaction validation and execution control.

**Challenge-Based Verification**
Manager qualification is determined through transparent, meritocratic challenges that require traders to demonstrate profitable performance within defined risk parameters. This system eliminates subjective criteria and ensures only proven traders access protocol capital.

**Oracle Infrastructure**
Real-time performance monitoring is provided through a NATS-based oracle system that processes trading data and updates on-chain challenge states. This ensures accurate, timely verification of manager performance.

**Policy Framework**
The protocol implements a flexible policy system allowing vaults to be associated with different validation programs, from unrestricted access to challenge-based qualification requirements. The validation system uses a unified `validate` function with operation-specific contexts, enabling consistent validation patterns across all policy types.
