## Implementation Status

**Current Status**: The $HYRO token and tokenomics system described above are planned for future implementation. The protocol currently operates without a native token while core features are developed.

**Timeline**: Token implementation is planned for Phase 2 of protocol development, expected to be implemented alongside the governance system after completion of core protocol features.

**Note**: All tokenomic parameters are subject to governance adjustment through proper DAO voting procedures. Initial parameters will be managed by admin multisig until full DAO transition is completed.
